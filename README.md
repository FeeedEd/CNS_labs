# CNS_labs
Code and outputs of the laboratory sessions of the "Computational Neuroscience" course, University of Pisa

Lab1:
Implementation of spiking neurons using the Izhikevich's model, developing all the 20 neuro-computational features of biological neurons and plotting the membrane potential's time courses and phase portraits

Lab2_1:
Implementation of the Hebbian learning mechanichs in a linear firing rate model, plotting
  (P1) the training data points, the final weight vector resulting from the learning process and the principal eigenvector of the input correlation matrix
  (P2) the evolution in time of the two components of the weight vector and the evolution in time of the two norm of the weight vector.
  
Lab2_2:
Implementation of a Hopfield network to reconstruct distorted images and plotting all the possible combinantions of the hyper-parameters values.

Lab3_1:
Implementation of a Time Delay Neural Network and of a Recurrent Neural Network for the prediction of a 10th order non-linear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) system and plotting both the target and output signals over time and the learning curve (with the training error).

Lab3_2:
Implementation of a Echo State Network (with reservoir guesses) for the prediction of a 10th order non-linear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) system and plotting the target and output signal.

Models of Photonic RC:
Seminar on recent advances of Photonic Reservoir Computing given on the exam day.
